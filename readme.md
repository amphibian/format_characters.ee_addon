This plugin formats text with the typography library's `format_characters()` method, converting double and single quotes to their curly entities; single and double hyphens to en- and  em-dashes; double spaces to non-breaking spaces; and encoding ampersands.

_Compatible with ExpressionEngine&reg; 3.0+ and ExpressionEngine&reg; 2.6+._
